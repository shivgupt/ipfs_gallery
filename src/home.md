# Welcome

Hi! This is my toy project with an aim to
  develop some web developer skills
  play with decentralized tools and blockchain
  develop some writing skills
  share my thoughts with the world

The contents of this blog as well as the direction in which this project is going would change very frequently but none of the contents would be lost - Big Thanks to IPFS - and can always be accessible via the hash of the contents.
